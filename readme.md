# Canvareum
#### SER National | AWS re/Start inspired project. 

[SER National](<https://ser-national.org/aws-restart>) has teamed up with AWS re/Start program to prepare a class of 99 students for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. In this course, we are using Canvas for the LMS and Vocareum's quizzing features. As of now, the instructors have to manually export grades from Vocareum to Canvas. *The initial deliverable of this project is to automate the grading and migration of said grades from Vocareum to Canvas.* 

Ultimately, the larger goal is to create a suite of functionality that will aid in obtaining reports and statistics but also automate repetitive task or add non-native functionality to meet class needs.

>  This project is at its infancy, as I progress I will carve-out this readme better.
